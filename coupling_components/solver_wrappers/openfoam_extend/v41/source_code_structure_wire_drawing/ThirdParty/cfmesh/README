  terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
  Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later
  version.

* System requirements
  cfMesh is developed and tested on Linux and MS Windows.

* Installation
  Binaries and the source code can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/cfmesh/

* Building from Sources (Optional)

  cfMesh can be built with recent versions of OpenFOAM and foam-extend. In order to build the library, a working OpenFOAM environment is needed. The build started by the Allwmake script located in this folder. It can be built with gcc and mingw compilers which support OpenMP (gcc-4.2.4 and above). Other compilers are not tested. This instructions are valid for Linux, only. We encourage Windows users to download the binary package.

* Getting Started

  Copy the 'tutorials' examples directory in the cfMesh distribution to the
  'run' directory.  If the OpenFOAM environment variables are set correctly,
  then the following command will work correctly:

  + cp -r tutorials $FOAM_RUN

  Run the first example case of a simplified car body:

  + cd $FOAM_RUN/tutorials/asmoOctree
  + cartesianMesh

  All cases have Allrun and Allclean scripts guiding you through the meshing process.
