# Fluent

This is the documentation for all Fluent solver wrappers.
The focus of this page is on fluid-structure interaction (FSI). Currently no other multiphysics problems are supported, but these are envisioned in future developments. FSI with inviscid flows is not supported, but that would be straightforward to add if required.


## Fluid-structure interaction with Fluent

ANSYS Fluent can be used to solve the flow field in partitioned FSI simulations. The FSI interface consists of one or several *surface threads* in Fluent. 
During each FSI iteration, the solver wrapper imposes a certain displacement on this FSI interface. Fluent then automatically deforms the rest of the mesh (using dynamic mesh capabilities), solves the flow field and returns the calculated loads on the FSI interface to the solver wrapper. 
Displacements are applied in Fluent in *nodes*. As displacements are the input of Fluent, these nodes are collected in one or more `ModelParts` in the *input* `Interface`. 
Loads (pressure and traction) can be obtained from the Fluent *faces*. As loads are the output of Fluent, these faces are collected in one or more `ModelParts` in the *output* `Interface`.
A fixed naming convention is used for the Fluent `ModelParts` in CoCoNuT: each `ModelPart` gets the name of the corresponding Fluent surface thread, plus "_nodes" or "_faces", depending on their content. As a consequence, each `ModelPart` in the input `Interface` has a counterpart in the output `Interface`. 
More information about `ModelParts` and `Interfaces` can be found in the [data structure documentation](../../../data_structure/data_structure.md).


## Parameters

This section describes the parameters in the JSON file, listed in alphabetical order.

|                                  parameter | type  | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This parameter is usually specified in a higher `Component`.                                                                                                                                                             |

`timestep_start` and `delta_t` are necessary parameters, but are usually defined already in the parameters of the coupled solver. However, they can also be given directly as parameter of the solver wrapper (e.g. for standalone testing). If they are defined both in the coupled solver and in the solver wrapper, then the former value is used and a warning is printed.

If different parameters are used with different Fluent versions, this should be specified both in this section and in the version specific documentation section.


## Overview of operation

The solver wrapper consists of 3 files (with X the Fluent version, e.g. "v2023R1"):

-   *`X.py`*: defines the `SolverWrapperFluentX` class, 
-   *`fluent.jou`*: Fluent journal file to interactively run the FSI simulation, written in Scheme, 
-   *`fluent.c`*: Fluent UDF file that implements additional functionality used in Fluent, written in C.

### The `initialize` method

During initialization, the journal and UDF files are adapted (parameter values are filled in) and copied to the `working_directory`. Fluent is then started in that directory using the parameters `cores`, `dimensions` and `fluent_gui`. Fluent then writes a case summary, so that the solver wrapper can link the interface thread names (specified in `thread_names`) to Fluent thread IDs, for use in the UDFs. Then the `Model` and `ModelParts` are created, based on data written by Fluent in time step 0. After a restart, this same data must be found, i.e. if those data files are removed from the `working_directory` folder, the simulation cannot be restarted. Finally, the `Interfaces` are created. 

### Files created during simulation

In these file conventions, A is the time step number and B the Fluent thread ID.

-   Fluent case and data files are saved as files of the form *`case_timestepA.cas`* and *`case_timestepA.dat`*.
-   Current node and face coordinates are passed from Fluent to CoCoNuT with files of the form *`nodes_timestepA_threadB.dat`* and *`faces_timestepA_threadB.dat`*. 
-   The new node coordinates are passed from CoCoNuT to Fluent with files of the form *`nodes_update_timestepA_threadB.dat`*.
-   Pressure and tractions are passed from Fluent to CoCoNuT with files of the form *`pressure_traction_timestepA_threadB.dat`*.
-   Files with extension *`.coco`* are used to exchange messages between CoCoNuT and Fluent. 



## Setting up a new case

Following items should be set up and saved in the Fluent case file (this list may be non-exhaustive):

-   additional UDFs must be configured, 
-   steady/unsteady (should match with the `unsteady` parameter),
-   2D, 3D or axisymmetric (should match with the `dimensions` parameter),
-   dynamic mesh zones for all deforming surfaces, except for the FSI interfaces,
-   dynamic mesh smoothing parameters,
-   boundary conditions, material properties, numerical models, discretization schemes, operating conditions, turbulence modeling, convergence criteria.

A data file should also be present with the fields either initialized or containing the results of a previous calculation.

Following items are taken care of by CoCoNuT, and must therefore not be included in the Fluent case file:

-   dynamic mesh zones for the FSI interfaces (these are defined in `thread_names`),
-   the time step (`delta_t`).

## Running multinode

To start a multinode simulation, a hosts file has to be present in the working directory.
This is a text file containing the machine names, each on a new line.
The name of this file has to be communicated to CoCoNuT by providing it as the value of the parameter `"hosts_file"` in the Fluent JSON settings.

For example, on the HPC system of the UGent, such a file with name _`fluent.hosts`_ can be created with the command
```bash
cat $PBS_NODEFILE > fluent.hosts
```

## Solver coupling convergence

The convergence criterion [solver coupling convergence](../../convergence_criteria/convergence_criteria.md#solver-coupling-convergence) is implemented for the Fluent solver wrapper.
Instead of comparing the different residuals (continuity, x-velocity, ...) with their respective tolerances before the first iteration, they are checked after the first iteration due to implementation restrictions.


## Version specific documentation

The results can be slightly different when restarts are used for multi-core simulations for the following reason: *For parallel cases with smoothing that do not use dynamic load balancing, a zonal partitioning with Laplace smoothing will automatically be applied when the file is read, which should result in better load balancing for the mesh smoothing calculations.*
After a restart, the partitioning can be different and hence the mesh deformation can be slightly different.
